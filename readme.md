# Complaint Management Portal
This is a simple, single-page web application for managing and tracking customer complaints. Users can submit new complaints, and the system automatically assigns a unique tracking ID. Complainants can then use this ID to check the real-time status of their submission.

Features
Submit a Complaint: A straightforward form for users to detail their issue.

Auto-Generated Tracking ID: Each complaint is assigned a unique ID upon submission.

Status Tracking: Users can enter their tracking ID to view the current status of their complaint (e.g., Submitted, In Progress, Resolved).

Real-Time Updates: The status is updated automatically, so there's no need to refresh the page.

Responsive Design: The portal is designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices.

How It Works
This application is built as a single index.html file, which includes all the necessary HTML, CSS (using Tailwind CSS for a modern look), and JavaScript. It uses Firebase Firestore for a real-time, cloud-based database to store and manage all complaint data.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the page structure.

Tailwind CSS: For styling and a responsive layout.

Getting Started
Since this is a single-file application, you can simply open the index.html file in any modern web browser to run the portal. No server setup is required.

Planned Improvements
Admin Dashboard: A separate view for administrators to manage and update the status of complaints.

Email Notifications: Automatic email alerts to users when the status of their complaint changes.

Search and Filter: Advanced search functionality for administrators to find specific complaints.
